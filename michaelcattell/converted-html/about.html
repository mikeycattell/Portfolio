<div id="whoiworkwith" class="reveal-modal">
  <h3>Who I work with</h3>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <h4 class="standardh4">Small businesses</h4>
    <p>I love working with small businesses – I find this way you get close to the real project and you really get the feeling that you, a designer are making a huge difference to the workplace. I am happy to slot into the current team (if you have one) or manage projects and teams to get them done on time!</p>
    <h4 class="standardh4">if (developer ) echo "need a designer"; </h4>
    <p>I design, doing the heavy lifting stuff isn’t for me – im not made for searching through databases and long streams of code – I get confused and frazzled just thinking about it, but you are not either made to look at a screen pushing them curved corner squares around. Some say we could be a match made in heaven, but as I’m already married - I could never commit.</p>
    <p>I know where to put my code, and roughly what your code means (the simple stuff of course), so you can trust me not to break anything – but I maybe might need help sometimes!</p>
    <h4 class="standardh4">Startups – you energetic things</h4>
    <p>I have a fun and well fun history of working with start ups in California, so I am well versed in startups and the limitations, but I don’t care for them – I care for getting your product out there to wow the audience. I understand that the big word of the day is budget, so I am flexible to adjust my costs to match your dreams! I can do most things, so designing things for web as well as print is a joy for me! </p
       >
    <h4 class="stardardh4">Individuals – just you and me and some thinking</h4>
    <p>Like any good partnership, you have to start getting to know each other – and this is why I love working one on one, I get to know your passion for the project (be it your company or just you) and really give you something that is personal and something you can be proud of, and know you helped hugely in the progress of building your brand. I can advise on most things, all I ask for is a coffee before meetings.</p>
    <h4 class="standardh4">Anybody else</h4>
    <p>I have probarly missed out a ton of folks – but If I was to list them all this modal window would stretch longer than your mouse can scroll! Feel free to get in <a href=”contact” title=”get in touch and lets talk about it”>touch</a> with any work – I promise a fun project, crammed with creativity and a great experience! </p>
  </div>
  <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a> </div>
<div id="webapp" class="reveal-modal">
  <h3>Web, App and Mobile Design</h3>
  <h4 class="standardh4">Website design and build</h4>
  <p>Designing web sites is my bread and butter, it’s what I do. If you need a strong online presence, I ensure I can help in this area – I promise a website which will work on all ‘online devices’, any level of users will be able to use it, and I can also help and offer advice on setting up and assisting on your social media approaches.</p>
  <p>NOTE: I don’t do development work (the heavy stuff), I would need to outsource this, which I would be upfront about when it gets into this field, but I have more than enough really amazing developers on hand to help!</p>
  <h4 class="standardh4">Website design-only</h4>
  <p>Sometimes, companies have their own team of developers – this is fine, I can quite happily just design the site (in Photoshop / Fireworks) and hand them over to the developer. </p>
  <h4 class="standardh4">Website build-only</h4>
  <p>Of course, along companies who just have developers, sometimes you guys can just have a team full of designers – this is where I can come in and assist in building the front-end of your website. All I would need is the mockups of the website/emailer and ask a handful of questions and im off – doing that geeky stuff.</p>
  <h4 class="standardh4">WordPress Theme Design</h4>
  <p>WordPress – you’ve heard of it, but want the look of your site personalized. I can help you out.I have worked alongside WordPress for many years now, it has it all, a powerful CMS (content management system – simply put, it is where you can edit your site yourself (text wise), and also do blog posts easily!), it is also free! But of course, you need WordPress  to match your branding, this is where I come in. </p>
  <p>I will also help you understand the admin section, so you can blog/edit at ease</p>
  <h4 class="standardh4">Web App Design</h4>
  <p>I can deliver templates for your web app in HTML and CSS, ready to bolt on to your backend.</p>
  <p>From the initial planning phases, through wireframes and up to the finished product I can help you create usable and good-looking interfaces.</p>
  <h4 class="standardh4">Mobile App Design</h4>
  <p>I also can produce mobile app designs, similar to the website design brief – I will design in Photoshop/Fireworks and hand them over to your developers, clearly labeled with instructions on what goes where, and how it gets there!</p>
  <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a> </div>
<div id="whatidontdo" class="reveal-modal">
  <h3>What I don&#8217;t do</h3>
  <h4 class="standardh4">I thought You did hosting and domain names purchasing</h4>
  <p>This is something I do not do. I have no experience in fixing the I.T. things, so if your site goes down at 1am and you suddenly need it back to life, I honestly wouldn’t not know where to start. So I insist that you buy your own Host and domain names – of course I will assist and point you in the right direction when the time comes, and if you wish to get more technical I can even recommend some folks who can assist you even more.</p>
  <h4 class="standardh4">Ongoing website maintenance</h4>
  <p>There is a reason I don’t offer this service, I build most of my sites with Perch or WordPress (both are CMS’ – you can edit all text parts of the site yourself), so you wouldn’t need to call me at 3am with copy changes, you can quite simply change them yourself. Of course, you can come to me with changes, and I will advise on the best step forward. </p>
  <h4 class="standardh4">Development-only </h4>
  <p>I am a designer, I push squares around the screen, then I make them appear on websites – what I don’t do is high-end development. I specialize in design, so to have me doing the back-end stuff as well would just blow my mind, and I quite like having my mind not blown up! </p>
  <p>Again, I have a list of powerful, wonderful and quite frankly to good to be true developers that I can happily call and get them onboard – all of which I will be upfront with you about, I will also manage them so we are all on the same singing sheet!</p>

      <h3 class="standardh3">My History</h3>
      <p>I have been in this game for 8 years, working with digital agencies in Yorkshire, to being Senior designer based in South California <i>(it is true, it is a lot more sunnier there than England)</i>, which has allowed me to experience the ups and downs <del>we all know sometimes things don’t work out how they are suppose to</del>. So I am well versed in most things web-ster-ish, thus leaving us both to not suffer from sleepless nights and panicky phonecalls at 3am.</p>

      <h3 class="standardh3">My Methods</h3>
