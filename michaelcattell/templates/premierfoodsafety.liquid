        <p class="intro">Clean, simple and very assessable to all levels of users, with ages ranging from 16-80, male and female, entry level to management – we had to make all print and web work straightforward, which, for a product that can and is often accepted as being quite complicated, I think we achieved this.</p>

        <p class="intro">An important part of this company’s revenue is via incoming calls, sending out a flyer every quarter therefore is make or break – my task was to un-complicate quite a complicated flyer! I made the pricing as clear as possible, and also directed the user’s eye to right side of the flyer (the manager would look to the left as that bit is relevant, but the right side is more for the entry level employees).</p>
