          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p class="intro">Argos is the UK's leading digital and in store retailer, I am sure sometime in your childhood you have been in there – trying to work out how many pens you can cram into your pocket <del>I got 5 before my mum noticed</del>! </p>
          <p>On average the stores (740 of them) and online services, serves around 130 million customers a year.</p>
          <p>The need was to design and build a website, answering to the Spain users of Argos (Ex Pats to be exact).</p>

        <p>Before setting out to build the site, we designed a plan of action, so to fall under the branding rules – to ensure consistent branding was kept. The famous red of Argos’ logo was to be used often to offset the blue that is linked with the company since INSERT YR.</p>
