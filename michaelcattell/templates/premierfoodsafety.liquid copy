    <p>Food safety in America is a big business, all companies (food based – restaurants etc) need to have a trained food handler, this is where Premier Food Safety come in.</p>
    <p>They are one of the largest and most reputable providers of food safety education in the United States, with 35+ years behind them and a client base which boasts of over 250,000 and counting and clients such as McDonalds, Panda Express and Subway.</p>
    


    <p>Statistics are boring right? Not really. When The Next Web introduced me to this project the goal was clear: Let's make statistics more fun. TNW has a great Twitter platform called <a href="http://www.twittercounter.com/">Twitter Counter</a> where they show statistics based on your Twitter activities. Quite boring yes, but helpful and interesting for a lot of people.</p>

    <p>The idea of Twitter Counter got a little outdated and TNW wanted to build something new, more fun. A place where you can see statistics based on your social media activities (not only Twitter) and give meaning to these stats. Besides these stats it needed to be a place where you could go to for funny stats and information about these social platforms. A community feeling.</p>
    
    <img class="work" src="../images/work/social-3.jpg" alt="Example Image" />
    
    <h2>Giving the user what they need</h2>
    
    <p>They needed planning, website, plus online training to be designed and built, slowly and gradually; so not to disrupt the current users – average traffic to the site is 600 users.</p>

    <p>The homepage of Social.co needed relevant information to get the user excited. Stats are not so boring when they are relevant to the user and updated every second. Combine this with stats you normally wouldn't think were possible to show and you have an interesting page where you can discover the platform stats.</p>

    <p>The interface is clear and simple: (Expandable) Menu on the left, content on the right. On every page. The interface is clear and understandable from the beginning. White-space is used to focus on the content off the so called widget blocks.</p>

    <img class="work" src="../images/work/social-4.jpg" alt="Example Image" />
    
    <h2>Your personal home, your own dashboard.</h2>
    
    <p>The user is excited and wants to know more about his own (or company's) data. A quick login to your account gives you access to the interactive Dashboard. A place where you can customize widgets, personalize your lay-out and add whatever widget you find necessary. <em>Boom.</em></p>
    
    <img class="work" src="../images/work/social-5.jpg" alt="Example Image" />
    
    <p>Every widget has a set of features that come in handy. We know your stats, so we give you advice based on your activities. Didn't get followers last week? Let's change that by doing this and this. Social.co will help you grow.</p>
    
    <h2>Quick updates & long reads: The Social Journal.</h2>
    
    <p>The latest news and in-depth articles. A frequently changing stream of news and information. Interact with the authors of the posts and discuss the content.</p>
    
    <img class="work" src="../images/work/social-2.jpg" alt="Example Image" />

    
    <p>
    When discussing the idea for a blog/news page for Social.co we kept coming back on the 'interactive' part. Users should feel at home on the blog. The community feeling I talked about before. The blog is seperated in two parts: short updates and in-depth articles.</p>

    <p>Everything comes together in a news stream, an updated version of the old list of posts. The stream shows the latest statuses, images and introductions to longer articles. In-depth articles are accessible by clicking the article in the stream, zooming in to the article where you can read the whole thing on it's own page.</p>
