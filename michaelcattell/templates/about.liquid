        <h2 class="mainstyle">Here is a brief history of me, what I do and why I could be your best friend.</h2>

        <p class="intro"><strong>Nice to meet you</strong>, I’m Michael. You can call me Michael, Mike, Mikey, or Jack. I am a digital designer. I have designed many projects like logos, websites, Emailers, mobile apps and birthday cakes. I highly suggest not asking me to design you a birthday cake, but your website I’ll gladly do.</p>
        <p class="intro"><strong>It all started in 2003</strong>, with online advertising at Yorkshire Post which lead me to other opportunities to expand my talents. I ended up in US working for a company in California leading a design team and completely rebranding Premier Food Safety.</p>
        <p class="intro"><strong>Back in the UK (a lovely sunny town, Doncaster)</strong>, I now run my own company - designing, building and bringing to life what your vision entails. My location allows me to service local businesses and clients in Yorkshire, while also having the ability to provide you great service anywhere else in the world remotely.</p>
        <p class="intro"><strong>I value the relationships I build with my clients</strong>, hence the genuine honesty you’ll get from me. Working closely with my clients, I tend to their needs. By truly understanding the business, its needs, market and target demographic, I will be able to produce you an effective and efficient product.</p>
