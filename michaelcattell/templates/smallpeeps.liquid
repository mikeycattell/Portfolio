        <p class="intro">From the previous layout, I decided it would be easier to do a more clean and simple approach to help the user buy more than one product, thus implementing featured products section and a carousel. </p>

        <h3 class="standardh3">Putting it all together</h3>
        <p class="intro">All that had to be done regarding the print side was update my previously designed business cards, product tags and complement slips (when ordered online) with the new logo. The website was more tricky, personalizing quite a rigid template with tiny improvements (carousel, free postage sticker, featured products section and making it look cuter) alongside a quite tutorial on best practices and use of the admin section.</p>
